# miniBaymax---A-low-cost-interactive-diagonostic-tool-for-Valvular-Heart-Disease-detection
This web application is motivated by Baymax of the animated movie Big Hero 6. It detects Valvular Heart disorder i.e. damage or defect in one of the four heart valves. On the Machine Learning side, I have used AutoML from the deep learning platform H2O. And the interactive application is build in RShiny.
